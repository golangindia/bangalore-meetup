# Host Requirements

This sheet contains a list of requirements that the Golang BLR Organizers expect potential Meetup hosts to fulfil.

## Required

### (A) Seating space for 50-60 people. Standing space within the room to additionally accommodate ~20 people if there are high RSVPs.

1. Organizers can give hosts an approximation on the number of potential attendees.
1. We typically see higher RSVPs two days prior to the meetup. We close RSVPs on Friday night prior to the Saturday morning meetup.
1. We announce and expect a first-come-first-serve policy on seating to attendees.
1. If space is insufficient, we expect attendees to join online via Zoom.us

### (B) Guest WiFi throughout the duration of the the meetup (morning 9:30am till ~2pm).

1. We record the meetup on Zoom.us.
1. Some guest join us live (including a few who might be seated in the audience, if they can't see the screen properly)

### (C) A projector/TV with a large display.

1. Typically, if the display is not large, we request guests to join the meeting via Zoom.us on their laptops.

### (D) Display connectors: VGA, DisplayPort(Mac), HDMI

### (E) Drinking water available throughout the duration of the meetup.

### (F) Light packed snacks available throughout the duration of the meetup. This could be chips, biscuits etc.

1. Please leave these on a table in an accessible area. The snack packets need not be opened by the host.
2. The expectation is that guests pick these up and consume these as and when necessary to avoid wastage. The unopened ones could be stored in the host's pantry and used further.

### (G) Heavy snacks & beverages available at 12 noon. This could be samosas, sandwiches, bakery items, pizza etc. Beverages would be tea, coffee, packed juices etc.

1. Organizers can help provide a headcount around ~10:30am (30 minutes into the 1st talk).
1. Hosts would then have ~1.5 hrs, if a heads-up is required for quantity finalization for food arrangements.

### (H) A point-of-contact from the Host to be available throughout the duration of the meetup.

1. The organizers will require assistance from the host in setup and coordination regarding snacks etc.


## Good to have

### (i) Clip-on Microphone for the presenter.

A clip-on microphone (with speaker arrangements) helps ensure that the presenter is heard across the room. This makes it less stressful for the presenter and also ensures that the audienec is attentive.
The organizers do not insist on a Clip-on mic as a mandatory requirement, but it has proved to be very useful.

### (ii) Notebooks, Pens:

Not all guests carry a laptop to the meetup. Some of our attendees are students. Typically ~15-20 notebooks, pens do help for ~60 attendees.




## Information that the organizers would like the hosts to provide:

1. Is the signage for the company visible prominently? If not, please provide a landmark and notes on what to look out for (Example: Above so-n-so, opposite so-n-so)
2. Is there sufficient 2-wheeler & 4-wheeler parking inside the premises (not-mandatory)? If not, is public parking around the premises easily available? Please think of this point from the PoV of a guest having to find parking before attending the meeting. If you feel finding parking might be difficult, we'll pass on a note to attendees to arrive in advance.
3. What's the process for guest registration (at the reception desk of the Host)? Organizers would like to gauge how much time an attendee might spend in registering, before attending the 1st talk. If the registration is elaborate (e-registration, photo, serial-no reg. of laptop etc), then we'd like to announce early arrival for all guests.
4. Name, Mobile number of the point-of-contact from the host.
